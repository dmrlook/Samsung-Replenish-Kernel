This repository will contain the open source samsung replenish (SPH-M580) kernel source code, plus additional changes to get it to compile and run on the replenish, as well as changes to improve upon the original replenish.  I will post changes to this file.

Commit Notes (most recent first, oldest at bottom):

Commit: Initial rev - identical to samsung opensource download
  --> This commit adds all the source code exactly as it came from the samsung open source website.  This is equivalent to release FA19 (gingerbread, with security update) on their website.  Note the files committed under this commit will not build as is.  Future commits will address this.
